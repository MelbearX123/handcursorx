Re-training the AI model for this project! 

A real-time, gesture-controlled mouse system that uses a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model to detect hand gestures from a webcam feed and map them to OS-level mouse actions such as clicking, scrolling, and cursor movement.
This project explores computer vision, deep learning fine-tuning, and human–computer interaction, with an emphasis on building an ergonomic, hands-free alternative to traditional mouse input.
